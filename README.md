# User Guide

Before students start coming into the classroom, turn on the computer and projector. In the web browser, go to http://facorread.github.io/lectureClock/ and type your messages, instructions, clarifications about the exam contents, specific questions, glossary, rules, etc.

# Questions

Q. How do I change the messages?

A. Just click the text area and start typing.

Q. How do I set the total exam time?

A. Just click it and change it.

Q. Why the boring style?

A. White letters on a black background are easier on the eyes than black on white, particularly when looking at a screen or projection. Sans serif letters are easier to read, too. This project is designed to avoid distraction while presenting clear instructions and information.

Q. How do I change the font sizes?

A. Zoom in and out using your browser's controls.

Q. How do I change the colors, fonts, or sizes? How can I move the clock and timer around?

Use Chrome Developer Tools.
