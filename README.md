# User Guide

Edit the list of times and activities directly on index.html using your text editor.

Publish the page in your own website. An option for quick deployment is to use GitHub Pages. My particular address is https://facorread.github.io/lectureClock/

Open the published page in your phone or tablet. As time progresses, the app will highlight activities that are in progress using the green color, and when 2 minutes are left to finish an activity, the highlight color will be red.

# Questions

Q. How do I change the colors, fonts, or sizes? How can I move the clock?

Use Chrome Developer Tools or your favorite text editor to edit the html, css or javascript code.
